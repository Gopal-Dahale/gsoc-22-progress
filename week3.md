This was a introductory meet held on 8 June 9:30 IST. Sergei is also the org admin. He talked about last year's success. Everybody introduced themselves and talked about their projects in brief. He said we are the second most popular organization in GSoC and we all have done a good job.

We will be provided with more datasets. We have to limit the size of the dataset by using preprocessing techniques. Check out previous year projects. Read existing literature papers and also share them on mattermost. For now use the datasets of the tasks.

Mentors vary time to time as different mentors have different expertise. Our end goal is to apply our algorithms to particle physics data and comparing them with classical models with comparable number of trainable parameters. 

We will have biweekly meetings at the same time. Every meet discusses the progress on the project. Everybody shows the work using plots and couple of slides in approx 10 mins. Tell what have been done, what are the results, challenges and what you are gonna work in next week. Whats the big picture and what are the details.
